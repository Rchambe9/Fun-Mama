# Welcome to Fun Mama!
A blog of fun, creative activities you can do with your kids :)


### Goals
My goal was to build a dynamic web application with a MVC architecture using spring boot.
meaning...
- My web application has a static home page that accepts HTTP GET requests.
- It is a server-side rendered application that handles all of the application logic in a controlled environment.

# Also...

- I have made effective use of git and GitHub by making frequent commits.
- I created dynamic content with the ability for viewers to add content to the application through an HTML form.
